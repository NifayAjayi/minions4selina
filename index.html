                    <p> i miss you already and its only been about five hours, you are genuneily so so alluring to me, i really suck at expressing how i feel but it hurt like hell ignoring you all week. i mean i really did try to keep to myself this time to end the cycle of hurting each other, but i folded when i saw you smile again. i swear its so hard to act like i dont care irl because i get nervous and cheese so bad when im around you. i really like being in love with you, and even if you stopped, i dont think i could stop yk? like i think you deserve the best and i want to be that for you, i want to change for you and from today im gonna do everything i can to heal,change, study and do really well in school, so i can be good enough to marry you when we're older !!</p>

                    <h3>August 17, 2024</h3>
                    <p> thinking about how good your hair smelled that weekend, you smell really rich dude but not the point rn, after a while my heart starts to ache from missing you sm, its like you said when school starts and stuff it'll be worse but i really want to try, im really paranoid that when you start school youll find a girl and lose feeling for me and i dont really know what to do with these thoughts, like i think about ghosting you again but i dont want you to hate me and i want to be with you, i hate when you're absent in my life. i love you so so dearly you wouldn't even understand. first love theory is so real, i cant wait till i get over the stuff w s****r and i can show you off, cause again youve never really experienced healthy love from me and i want to change that.</p>
